# root_tagging_gui
This package is used to quickly tag features in images of roots. It can be used to measure angles and heights for any number of features, but it is currently set up to only measure several. It outputs a .csv with the measurements and the GUI parses each image.

The RootTaggingGUI was used in a publication: 
Hostetler AN, Erndwein L, Reneau JW, Cantera W, Stager A, Tanner HG, Cook DD and Sparks EE. 
“Brace root phenotypes predict root lodging susceptibility and the contribution to anchorage in maize” bioRxiv, 2021.
